footballshiny
=============

Simple scripts for scraping a football stats website and some basic analysis in [R]. This was a small project to get used to shiny- a lightweight web application for R.

The webscraper.py script is used to generate the data, and is stored in a directory named data/. Currently the data is stored in yaml format- but in future may be a flat file with common headings.

Analysis scripts look for the data directory in the cwd. 

The application is available online at http://spark.rstudio.com/nickharding/football_shiny/.
